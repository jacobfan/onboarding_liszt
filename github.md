We use git and github a lot. It's the forge to store nearly everything of our projects, including source code(git), knowledge base(wiki), project management(issues). Ideally, all the conversation, decisions, achievements should be put into github, so either team members or new comers could have some material to learn from.

A new buddy should join github and get access to the projects assigned, then contribute to them.

## Create a Github account

* Join Github at <https://github.com/join>, make sure to check the verification email in your mail box. 
* Give the fresh `username` to your team lead, who will help to give the access to the ongoing project (usually a private repo). 

## Issues

All the tasks, bug reports, feature enhancements could be an issue. Which is a thread to record everything including dicussion and decisions of a feature. Even though some features might become `invalid`, some bugs `wontfix` in the end, all those information worth to be recorded.

## Wiki

Wiki is like the wikipedia for the project knowledge. It supports editing in a very efficient format, like `markdown` which we use all the time.  

## Git

Git is the tool we use to manage all the source code, sometimes documents are included which is easier to be kept sync with the code base.
